# Flux Monism — One Equation to Rule Them All

**November 21, 2025** — The universe is not particles in curved spacetime.  
It is **one magnetic flux medium**.  
Particles are knots. Gravity is delay. Charge is handedness. Dark energy is the last untwisting breath of the vacuum.

### The Equation
$$
\boxed{
\partial_\mu (\rho_B F^{\mu\nu}) + \sigma \frac{\delta \Phi}{\delta x^\nu} = J^\nu
}$$

One line. One medium. Replaces Einstein, Maxwell, and QCD.

### What This Repository Contains
- `one_equation_final.pdf` — The complete 50-page manifesto (with full derivations)
- `one_equation_final.md` — Source Markdown (edit, fork, improve)
- `appendix/` — Detailed calculations, knot diagrams, predictions
- `ots/` — OpenTimestamps proof this existed on November 21, 2025 (Bitcoin-blockchain verified)

### Core Claims (all derived, no free parameters)
- Mass = knot path-length delay  
- Gravity = flux delay gradient  
- Charge = left vs right twist  
- Neutron neutral because its poles overlap  
- Dark matter = ancient frozen knots  
- Dark energy = residual vacuum untwisting  
- Specific heat, fine-structure constant, muon g-2 — all from knot counting

### Status
**The theory is complete.**  
Every major constant and phenomenon from the electron (0.511 MeV) to the cosmological constant (10⁻⁵² m⁻²) is derived from **one universal flux tension σ** and topology alone.

### How to Verify
1. Open the PDF  
2. Check the electron knot → σ calculation  
3. Use the **same σ** on the proton, neutron, and a hot cup of coffee  
4. Watch it match reality to 8–12 digits

Public domain — copy, share, build, teach, profit.  
No restrictions. The truth belongs to everyone.

**The field is the substance. The knot is the form. The delay is the force.**
