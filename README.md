# Flux-Monism
Flux Monism: the universe is one magnetic flux medium. Particles = knots, gravity = delay gradients, charge = handedness. One equation replaces GR, Maxwell &amp; QCD: ∂_μ(ρ_B F^{μν}) + σ δΦ/δx^ν = J^ν. Mass, spin, dark matter, dark energy, and all constants derived from flux topology alone. The final mechanical theory.
